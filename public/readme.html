    <h1>Online Shop</h1>
    <p>
        <b>What are you selling?</b>
        I'm selling medicine products.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>What additional pages did you add?</b>
        I added About Page, Team Page, Product Page and Contact Page.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>What was hard to do?</b>
        I've got an exception that it took me several hours to solve:
        <b>Maximum call stack size exceeded</b> and <b>Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>What did you do? What did your partner do?</b>
        I did the connection between the client-side and the routes. My partner implemented the interfacing with the Firebase Database.
